Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate
- Use `protobuf`, not `protobuff`
- If you just created something, wait at least a couple of weeks before submitting
- You should of course have read or used the thing you're submitting
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion
- Use the following format: `[name](link) - Description`
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive. You can also use the github repo description.
- Start the description with a capital
- Check your spelling and grammar
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant section
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome
- Pull requests should have a useful title and include a link to the package and why it should be included

Thank you for your suggestion!
